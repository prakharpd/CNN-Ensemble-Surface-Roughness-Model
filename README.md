# CNN-Ensemble-Surface-Roughness-Model
* Polished version of previous repository. By explaining each line of code.
* It is built for predicting surface roughness value of Inconel-718, a nickel-based superalloy.
* This model was further used as Pre-Trained Mode for Real Time Surface Roughness Predicition.
* Images can not be uploaded into Github. As it exceeds storage limit.
